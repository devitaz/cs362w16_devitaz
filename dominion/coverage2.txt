I found that each of my unit tests covered between 16% and 30% of the dominion.c code.There is not much I can infer based upon the results of the individual coverage tests. A total of 32.59% of dominion.c lines are covered by all the unit tests. This tells me that my unit testing covers about a third of the program which is pretty good for only testing 6 functions and 2 switch statements. Obviously, all lines would theoretically need to be executed for the testing to be most effective. One other problem is that mearly looking at coverage does not tell you if the tests were effectively written or if the conditions were even met which would allow the tests to fail.

Bug Report:

I found a bug in the function scoreFor() at line 441, in the third for loop. When the score is being evaluated from the deck, the for loop needs to iterate from i to deckCount. Currently it iterates from i to discardCount.
I found a bug in the function mine_card() at line 707, in the third if statement. The '>' in the conditional needs to be replaced with '<'.
