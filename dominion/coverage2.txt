I found that each of my unit tests covered between 16% and 33% of the dominion.c code.There is not much I can infer based upon the results of the coverage tests. Each test covers some percentage of the code that each other test covered so the results seem almost pointless. As far as I can tell, I seem to have fairly good coverage based on my experience of nothing using gcov.

Bug Report:

I found a bug in the function scoreFor() at line 441, in the third for loop. When the score is being evaluated from the deck, the for loop needs to iterate from i to deckCount. Currently it iterates from i to discardCount.
I found a bug in the function mine_card() at line 707, in the third if statement. The '>' in the conditional needs to be replaced with '<'.
